# ACS2019-RestaurantChatbot

The repository for Think.AI’s chatbot contains two folders; the restaurant-booking folder which contains the folders and files for the ‘restaurant-booking’ agent and the firebaseFulfillment folder which contains our webhooks which allows us to use user input extract by Dialogflow’s natural language processing to create dynamic responses and trigger actions on the back-end.

The restaurant-booking folder contains the code for each of our intents and entities and the firebaseFulfillment folder contains the index and package code.
