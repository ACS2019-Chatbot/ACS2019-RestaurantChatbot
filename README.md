Deliverable of UTS 41004 Analytics Capstone Project Autumn 2019

The Client and Business Problem
Sapphire, a top 5-star fine-dining restaurant, thrives on providing the ultimate customer experience throughout all their services. Being in the top range of the industry, service within the restaurant is of high quality, similar to Sapphire’s competitors, thus it also becomes difficult to observe areas of improvement to remain at the top. 
Sapphire has approached Think.AI with the aim to further enhance their service with artificial intelligence and utilize our expertise in the area. In a rapidly evolving technological world, it is vital for the client to keep up with the potential artificial intelligence presents for the restaurant.

Chatbot
Think.AI has identified the vital functionalities that the customer service team at the restaurant currently provides and wishes to include in our enhanced AI solution. This includes the ability to:
1. make, change and cancel reservations
2. enquire about the price of specific menu items
3. request to see the menu.

The repository for Think.AI’s chatbot contains two folders; the restaurant-booking folder which contains the folders and files for the ‘restaurant-booking’ agent and the firebaseFulfillment folder which contains our webhooks which allows us to use user input extract by Dialogflow’s natural language processing to create dynamic responses and trigger actions on the back-end.

The restaurant-booking folder contains the code for each of our intents and entities and the firebaseFulfillment folder contains the index and package code.
